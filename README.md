## Contributing
This is being written by Samuel Faubert. My email is samuel.faubert@mail.mcgill.ca. I am excited to be working alongside you! I believe for optimal workflow we need strong, consistent communication and organization. The following are rules I want to follow to acheive these goals:
1. Please use the project board and issue system I have implemented when making ANY change. There are some examples of completed issues already, but if you have any question please reach out to me.
2. I intend to use eslint and prettier for code style and organization. Please install these before contributing any changes. They should be available on all the major IDEs and text editors.
3. Before making a PR, ensure that you have tested on a freshly built Docker image. I am happy to help with anything regarding Docker if you are unfamiliar.\
Thank you for respecting the rules laid out. Please let me know of any question, concerns, suggestions, etc.
